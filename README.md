# ML and Python Practice 

This repository is my personal space to practice and sharpen my machine learning, data science, and Python coding skills.  
It includes small experiments, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hands-on practice with various ML techniques.

## What's Inside
- Data cleaning & EDA
- Model building (classification, regression, clustering)
- Scikit-learn pipelines & preprocessing
- Modular coding and Git version control
- VSCode environment setup and best practices

## Goal
To build and document a consistent practice routine while learning industry-aligned ML workflows and tools.

## Note
This repo is actively evolving.
